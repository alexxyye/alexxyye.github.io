## **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave: and I like to know about how our brain works! I'm a Research Associate working at *BLC lab* in Hong Kong PolyU right now and you can visit [my page](https://blclab.org/xinyi-ye/). 

I'm interested in studying **psychology** and **language** using neuroimaging methods such as EEG and fMRI. My major focus of study is language perception and comprehension (listening and reading especially). Still, I'm also interested in visual and auditory processing in general. I also like to use computational models to analyze data.

In my leisure time I enjoy cooking, hiking, swimming and K-pop :laughing:

If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to see my [CV](https://github.com/alexxyye/alexxyye.github.io/blob/main/docs/CV221014.pdf) here :smile:.
