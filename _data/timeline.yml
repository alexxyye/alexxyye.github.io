  description: I analyzed how the brain learn new words in Virtual Reality using a combination of 
              EEG and VR equipments. I use EEGLAB and FieldTrip pipeline for the majority of the 
              analyses and designed the VR settings with my colleagues. Along with traditional EEG 
              signal analyses we also involve deep learning models to further analyze our data.
