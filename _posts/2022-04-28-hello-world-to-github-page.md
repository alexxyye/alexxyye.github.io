description: Alex's first try of GitHub Page to build a personal website.

One day I accidently found that I can actually use Github Page to host a personal website for FREE and without ANY advertisement. In addition, I can individualize every single aspect of this website (the layouts, the styling, etc.), and all I'll need is just a little bit of coding, and it's mostly HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, and there are loads of templates online for me to choose and individualize.

That is wonderful!

So I learnt about how to use Ruby and Jekyll to host a website, and tried revising several templates, and here it is! My personal website.

The template I'm using right now is [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU). I think it's pretty simple and beutiful at the same time so I chose it. Many thanks to the author!

Hello world!
